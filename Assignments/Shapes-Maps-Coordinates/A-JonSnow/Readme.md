# Shapes, Maps, and Coordinates

There is an already installed uv environment for this topic.
In order to use it in Jupyter Notebook/Lab, you need to add it as a kernel. To do this, run the following command:
```# activate the environment
cd /v/courses/2026-dataexplorationandvisualization2026.public/uv_envs/dataexp_shapesmaps/
source .venv/bin/activate
# install the kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dataexp_shapesmaps --display-name "Python (dataexp_shapesmaps)"
```
After running the above command, you should see the new kernel option "Python (dataexp_shapesmaps)" when you create a new notebook in Jupyter Notebook/Lab. You can select this kernel to use the virtual environment for your image exploration tasks.
You might have to reload the page first to see the new kernel option.

# Create virtual environment with `uv`
Create an environment first:
```
uv venv
```
Then install the required packages using a 'requirements.txt' file:
```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

You need to have the 'ipykernel' package installed, which is included in the 'requirements.txt' file. This package allows you to use the virtual environment as a kernel in Jupyter Notebook.
To add the virtual environment as a kernel in Jupyter Notebook/Lab, run the following command:
```
# activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
# install the kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dataexp_networks --display-name "Python (dataexp_networks)"
```
After running the above command, you should see the new kernel option "Python (dataexp_networks)" when you create a new notebook in Jupyter Notebook/Lab. You can select this kernel to use the virtual environment for your image exploration tasks.
You might have to reload the page first to see the new kernel option.

## Create conda environment for the notebooks

Normally we start with `conda init`, but in Kooplex's docker container it does not work. Instead 
```bash
. /opt/conda/bin/activate
conda create -n datavis_shapesmaps --yes --file requirements.txt
```
